# Weather-App
An app that display you the weather in every place in the world. (Using Google maps of course)

Hello every one.
This is an simple app, that by 2 http request show you the weather in every place in the world.
I wrote in node.js language.

proper disclosure, I am taking course on udemy.com in node.js , and the idea for the app, and part of the implementation is from there,
so I recommend you to take this course! 
The author of this course is awesome, and explain the course perfectly.

the course name: "The Complete Node.js Developer Course (2nd Edition)" from www.udemy.com

It's important to me to say that I add to this app some features , like report for all the address you ever search for.
The report is written to the file : "weather-data.json".

The code is calling 2 http request.
1 -> to Google maps for getting the exactly location on earth. 
2 -> to https://darksky.net/dev/register -> weather site that supply my app the weather. (you have to register to the site if you want to use it).

In addition , as you can see at the code I used at "axios" -> a library of node.js
and yargs, also a library.

I add an image that show how it works!

Enjoy :)
